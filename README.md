# wound-calcium
The files in this repository are Mathematica notebooks (.nb) and package files (.m). These notebooks were written to model wound-induced calcuim responses in epithelia that follow from an upstream protease cleavage of a pro-ligand to release active ligand that then binds to a G-protein coupled receptor. The models are described in full in the publication </BR></BR>
